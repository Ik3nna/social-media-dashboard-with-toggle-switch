I developed a social media dashboard with a toggle switch that switches from dark mode to light mode. I had to apply the knowledge of creating a toggle switch I gained from the project before this. I also had to set up two different groups of color palettes for the light and dark sections. Finally, I used javascript to set up the default mode of the webpage and the toggle function that enables the webpage switch from one mode to another when the switch is clicked.

I would like to appreciate frontend mentor for providing the files used in the development of this project. The link to the challenge can be found below
